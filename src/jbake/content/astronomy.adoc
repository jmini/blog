I'm an amateur astronomer, a passion since I'm a child.
I own a Celestron C9.25 CPC Deluxe EdgeHD. 
I'm still a beginner in astrophotography, here you can find some images I took, you should be able to see the improvements as a gain experience :)

== Images

=== M101, 11 April 2019

This is a combination of 35 times 4 minutes exposure (total 140 minutes).

- Celestron CPC 9.25 Deluxe EdgeHD
- Equatorial table Celestron WedgeHD Pro
- Focal reducer 0.7x
- CCD: QHY8L
- Celestron Off-Axis guider
- Guiding CCD: QHY5L-II-C

This is also the first time I'm using flat frames (not because I'm lazy but because it's not super simple to do). I could have gathered more images, but f* Windows decided to reboot for an update in the middle of the night, a few minutes after I had decided to go to bed to try to get some sleep during the night (it was 2am and I wanted to gather 1h more of data). Anyway, here's the result, I think I can get a little more from raw data with experience with PixInsight:

And an annotated version:

=== M64, the Black-Eye galaxy, 10 April 2019

This one gave me troubles for processing. I should have used flats, but unfortunately I wasn't able to. It's a combination of 23 images of 4 minutes pause, using autoguiding.

First attempt with autoguiding.

=== A slice of Rosetta, 24 February 2019

Given my setup, I can't have the full nebula in a single field, so this is just a slice :)

=== The Horsehead Nebula, 22 February 2019

I'm still a beginner, this picture shows some artifacts, but I'm pretty happy with it!
