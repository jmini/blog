Exporting your awesome HTML5 presentation to PDF
------------------------------------------------

For some time now, I’ve started using https://imakewebthings.com/deck.js/[deck.js] to write my talks. One of the reasons I do this is that it saves me *lots* of time when I have to copy and paste code, because I can rely on javascript code highlighting libraries to do the job. I can focus on contents instead of rendering. If I had a better knowledge of CSS, too, I could certainly write impressive presentations (but unfortunately, no, I’m not good at CSS).

The problem with HTML5 slideshows is that you are often asked to upload your slides as PDF. For example, https://speakerdeck.com/[SpeakerDeck], https://www.slideshare.net/[SlideShare] or https://www.parleys.com/[Parleys] all require you to upload slides as PDF. None of them supports HTML5 (which is understandable because there are many frameworks available). While I did find some libraries that did the job (often in Perl or Ruby), I never managed to find one that actually worked properly.

Deck2pdf
--------

That’s where it all started. I knew that JavaFX2 provided a WebView, which allowed rendering HTML pages with WebKit. What if I could use it to render my slide deck and export it to PDF? https://github.com/melix/deck2pdf[deck2pdf was born!]. I started with something that was able to export my https://imakewebthings.com/deck.js/[deck.js] presentations, but I figured out very quickly that it could support other HTML5 presentation libraries quite easily. As of today, https://github.com/melix/deck2pdf[deck2pdf] supports:

* https://imakewebthings.com/deck.js/[deck.js]
* https://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js[reveal.js]
* https://bartaz.github.io/impress.js[impress.js]
* and https://github.com/paulrouget/dzslides[DZSlides]

But more importantly, if your favorite HTML5 slideware is not supported, adding custom profiles is supported and fairly easy! Adding support for another library is as simple as adding a descriptor file with the javascript commands inside. For example, here’s how the https://imakewebthings.com/deck.js/[deck.js] profile is written:

[source]
----
totalSlides=$.deck('getSlides').length
nextSlide=$.deck('next')

----


That’s all! Support for more complex interactions is also provided using Groovy profiles, like for example in https://bartaz.github.io/impress.js[impress.js]:

[source]
----
setup = {
    js 'var api = impress();'
    js '''var $$ = function ( selector, context ) {
        context = context || document;
        return context.querySelectorAll(selector);
    };'''
    js '''var byId = function ( id ) {
        return document.getElementById(id);
    };'''
}

nextSlide = {
    js('api.next()')
}

totalSlides = {
    js (/$$(".step", byId('impress')).length/)
}

// longer pause because of transitions
pause = 2000
