A few weeks ago, I started this new blog and decided to host it on GitHub. I already explained
link:/blog/2013/11/21/a_new_home.html[how I migrated contents from JRoller], but I didn't really
the tool behind publishing. In this post, I will show you how easy it is, now that I have
improved my toolchain with {gradle}!

== JBake

{jb} is a static site generator. When I chose this tool for my blog,
what attracted me is actually that it runs on the JVM, so I already had the idea of automating
stuff with {gradle}.

Since then, I have submitted several pull requests to the project, and we're actually thinking
of using it to build the next Groovy website. {jb} has good chances to
become the "Jekyll of the JVM" and already supports multiple markup languages (markdown, asciidoc)
as well as multiple template engines (https://freemarker.org/[FreeMarker] in 2.2.1, https://groovy.codehaus.org[Groovy]
and https://www.thymeleaf.org/[Thymeleaf] in 2.3.0).

The idea behind {jb} is very simple: contents is written using a markup language and "baked"
with template engines into actual HTML. Everything is generated statically and you can upload the generated site
wherever you want.

On the other side, GitHub offers a nice tool to publish pages: https://pages.github.com/[GitHub Pages], so we can
have both the sources of our blog and the output of bakery in the same repository. So the initial process looked
like this:

. create a new page in `content` directory
. run `jbake` command, check the result, eventually make changes
. `git add page.adoc` to add the new page to the sources
. `git commit -a` to commit the page to the `master` branch, corresponding to the sources of the blog
. `git checkout gh-pages` to switch to the GitHub pages branch
. `cp -R output/* .` to copy the contents of the output directory at the root of the GitHub pages
. `git add page.html` to add the new page to the GitHub pages branch
. `git commit -a` to commit the contents to GitHub pages
. `git push origin master` to push the sources to GitHub
. `git push origin gh-pages` to push the generated pages to GitHub pages

I published my first blog posts like this, and it's not that complicated, but it involves a lot of manual steps, so I
came up with a Gradle plugin to make this much easier, that is, focusing on contents, period!

== Gradle to the rescue!
=== Prerequisites

We're going to setup a project that will allow you to publish to GitHub pages in one step, using {gradle}. For that,
we will need:

* an empty _blog_ repository that you created on GitHub
* {jb} to setup the initial JBake project structure
* {gradle} 1.10 (previous versions should work too)
* The https://github.com/jbake-org/jbake-gradle-plugin[JBake plugin for Gradle], will be downloaded automatically
* The https://github.com/ajoberstar/gradle-git[Git plugin for Gradle], will be downloaded automatically

=== Building JBake

This step will become optional when JBake 2.3.0 will be out (or a snapshot of {jb} will be published). Meanwhile, you
need to install a local version of {jb} into your local Maven repository. Don't worry, this will be easy, you will
only need Maven (hey, too bad {jb} doesn't use Gradle ;)):

----
git clone https://github.com/jbake-org/jbake.git
cd jbake
mvn install
----

That's all!

=== Setting up a project

First step consists in creating the initial project layout:

----
git init                                                            <1>
git remote add origin <your github remote url>                      <2>
mkdir -p src/jbake                                                  <3>
gradle init                                                         <4>
git add build.gradle gradle gradlew gradlew.bat settings.gradle src <5>
cd src/jbake
jbake -i                                                            <6>
----
<1> initializes the git repository
<2> add your remote
<3> we will put JBake sources into that directory
<4> installs the Gradle wrapper into the repository
<5> adds Gradle wrapper and initial structure into Git
<6> initializes the default JBake directory layout

=== Using Gradle to render pages

At this point, your `src/jbake` directory contains the classic {jb} folder contents:

----
src
 |-- jbake
       |-- assets    : static assets (images, css, ...)
       |-- content   : blog posts, ...
       |-- templates : HTML templates (by default, uses FreeMarker)
----

Replace the contents of `build.gradle` with the following:

[source,groovy]
.build.gradle
----

buildscript {
  repositories {
      mavenLocal() // needed to use the local JBake 2.3.0 build
      jcenter()
  }

  dependencies {
    classpath 'me.champeau.gradle:jbake-gradle-plugin:0.1-SNAPSHOT' <1>
    classpath 'org.asciidoctor:asciidoctor-java-integration:0.1.4'  <2>
    classpath 'org.freemarker:freemarker:2.3.19'                    <3>
  }
}

apply plugin: 'jbake'                                               <4>
----
<1> import the JBake plugin
<2> if you write pages using the Asciidoctor format, this is necessary
<3> if you use the Freemarker template engine, this is necessary
<4> then apply the plugin

By default, the plugin will look for JBake sources in `src/jbake` and generate the site into `build/jbake`.

=== Generating the output

Now that this is applied, you can generate the site by running the following command:

----
./gradlew -i jbake
----

after the rendering step, you should now have a new directory:

----
build
  |-- jbake
----

into which you will find the generated HTML contents. At this point, you could choose to upload those files
to an FTP server, for example, but since we want to host our pages on GitHub, we need to add some configuration
to our build.

=== Publishing to GitHub Pages

Create a new file named `publish.gradle` with the following contents:

[source,groovy]
.publish.gradle
----
buildscript {
  repositories {
      jcenter()
  }

  dependencies {
    classpath 'org.ajoberstar:gradle-git:0.6.3'     <1>
  }
}

apply plugin: 'github-pages'                        <2>

githubPages {
  repoUri = 'git@github.com:youtname/blog.git'      <3>
  pages {
     from(file('build/jbake')) {
     	into '.'                                    <4>
     }
  }
}
----
<1> use the gradle-git plugin
<2> apply the plugin
<3> configure your GitHub repository URL
<4> tells the plugin to upload the contents of the `build/jbake` directory

Then modify the main `build.gradle` file by adding the following task:

[source,groovy]
----
task publish(type: GradleBuild) {           <1>
    buildFile = 'publish.gradle'
    tasks = ['publishGhPages']
}
----
<1> we're using a separate, sub-build to avoid a classpath issue with JNA

Now if you do:

----
./gradlew publish
----

Gradle will pick the contents of the `output/jbake` directory, add it to the `gh-pages` branch and push it to GitHub,
all in one step! A few seconds later, you should see the result on github.io!

One last thing: this configuration does *not* add the sources to your git repository. It only deals with the output,
so you still need to add the source files, commit them and push them to GitHub. This is of course optional if you
don't want to publish the sources... If you decide to make them public, then you can also use the git plugin to do it
automatically!

== Conclusion

In this post, we've shown you how you can leverage {jb} and {gradle} to publish a blog on GitHub. The setup is really
easy, so I hope more people will follow that way and contribute to Open Source too!

Of course, this post has been published using the procedure described on this page, so I used {jb} and {gradle} to blog
about how to publish a blog on https://github.com/melix/blog[GitHub] using {jb} and {Gradle}! Like my friend Andres Almiray
would say, that's a https://twitter.com/aalmiray/status/429236158321950720[toolception]!
