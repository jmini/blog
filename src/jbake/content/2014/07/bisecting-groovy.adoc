I had an interesting use case for `git bisect` today and as my blog also consistutes a good archive for things I don't
want to loose, let's take advantage of this to share the trick with you!

Normally, `git bisect` is used to find what commit introduced a regression in the codebase. For example, if you know
that current `HEAD` is buggy but that at least, RELEASE_1_0 was good, then you can write:

----
git bisect start             // <1>
git bisect bad               // <2>
git bisect good RELEASE_1_0  // <3>
----
<1> start bisecting
<2> tells that `HEAD` contains the regression
<3> tells that `RELEASE_1_0` is a tag corresponding to a version known not to have the bug

Git will checkout a revision that you can test, and you issue a list of `git bisect good` or `git bisect bad` commands
until it determines what commit introduced the regression.

This is a *very* practical way to find a regression. In Groovy, I've used this more than once, it's very useful.

== Reversing the logic

But today, I wanted to _reverse the logic_. Actually, we had a https://jira.codehaus.org/browse/GROOVY-6463[bug report]
and we found out that the bug was already fixed, but we didn't know in which version it was fixed. So actually, I didn't
want to find a regression, but a fix commit.

The idea to do this is to reverse the meaning of `bad` and `good` in `bisect`:

* `bad` becomes "doesn't produce a compile error"
* `good` becomes "produces a compile error"

And since the range of revisions to test was pretty big (we know that the error was reported on Groovy 2.2.1, but master
is 2.4.0), then I also took advantage of the `git bisect run` command, which automatically continues bisecting based on
a command line return status code.

So basically, here's what I wrote:

----
git bisect start                // <1>
git bisect bad master           // <2>
git bisect good GROOVY_2_2_1    // <3>
git bisect run ./bisect.sh      // <4>
----
<1> start bisecting
<2> master is known to have the fix, so we say *bad* is master
<3> GROOVY_2_2_1 is known to have the bug, so we say *good* is GROOVY_2_2_1
<4> start automatic bisecting thanks to the ./bisect.sh script

And what does _bisect.sh_ consist of? Here you go:

.bisect.sh
----
#!/bin/bash
export GROOVY_HOME=/tmp/testversion                                                                     // <1>
./gradlew clean -x javadoc -x groovydoc -x javadocAll -x groovydocAll -PskipIndy=true installGroovy     // <2>
/tmp/testversion/bin/groovy bisect.groovy || exit 0                                                     // <3>
exit 1                                                                                                  // <4>
----
<1> tells where the local build version of Groovy will be installed
<2> builds Groovy and installs it locally
<3> executes the test script and if the test fails, return a success exit code
<4> return a failure exit code

The trick is to *reverse the exit codes* in the script too: if the script compiles, then it means that the bug was fixed.
Since we reverse the logic, we then need the script to return a bad exit code! In case the script fails, we will return
a success (0) error code, because it means that the revision doesn't have the fix. Easy, but needs some mental contorsion :-)

You will note that this script uses `GROOVY_HOME` and a local installation path. You can configure it using the `$HOME/.gradle/gradle.properties` file,
and adding the following line in it:

.gradle.properties
----
groovy_installPath=/tmp/testversion
----

Eventually, here is the groovy script which served as a test case (almost copied directly from the JIRA issue):

[source,groovy]
.bisect.groovy
----
abstract  class Base<A> {
    abstract  void foo(A[] a)
}

class X {}

class Inheritor extends Base<X>{
    @Override
    void foo(X[] a) {}
//Groovyc: Can't have an abstract method in a non-abstract class.
//The class 'B' must be declared abstract
//or the method 'void foo([Ljava.lang.Object;)' must be implemented.
}

Inheritor
----

Note that each revision took around ~1 min 30s to test, even skipping the javadoc/groovydoc and indy versions of Groovy,
so you can imagine what benefit you have here in using automatic bisecting.

In the end, after around 20 minutes of automatic processing, I received this nice message:

----
74d991f9f8c39d2730a054431bf28e6516e61735 is the first bad commit

What? "bad commit"? Yes, remember that the logic is reversed, so "bad" means actually "fixed it". So it says that the
first commit which *fixed* the bug was actually `74d991f`. And here we go, issue closed ;) One improvement I can see
is to use a local clone of my repository instead of working directly in the same repository, so that I can continue
working on my copy while bisecting is in progress.
