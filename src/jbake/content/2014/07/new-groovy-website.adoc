Last week, we revealed the beta of a {groovylang}[brand new website for the Groovy language]. This
new website is {github-repo}[open sourced] and already received a few contributions.
In order to make it even easier and as it a fully statically generated site that makes use of Groovy
I wanted to give more technical details on the toolchain and how it is generated.

== A static website

One of the first questions which arised was: _why not use Grails/Spring Boot/Ratpack?_ In fact, the
new Groovy website is fully statically generated. It offers multiple advantages:

* hosting is much easier, as it only consists of static pages and assets
* maintenance is simplified, no database to backup for example
* everything is self contained, pages and data, into a {github-repo}[single repository]
* no need for authentication
* all content is public

Last but not least, we didn't have any requirement for storing anything in a database, or that would
require dynamic generation. Pull requests are enough so far. Eventually, we're thinking about a
blog, but even that can be statically generated even if you want to allow users to comment on articles
(this blog is a perfect example). So in short, this decision was motivated by one mantra:
_the right tool for the right job_.

The documentation, that you can find on https://beta.groovy-lang.org/documentation.html[this page], had
already started migrating from the aging wiki to {asciidoctor}. It is generated independently of the
website and integrated into it using iframes (we're thinking about source integration though).

== Structure of the project
=== Generator and site
The {github-repo}[project] is built using {gradle} and consists of 2 subprojects:

* the https://github.com/groovy/groovy-website/tree/master/generator[generator] project contains, as the name says,
the static generator. It makes use of a <<template-engine,template engine>> and provides the classes used in the model
of the templates.
* the https://github.com/groovy/groovy-website/tree/master/site[site] project contains the templates and data. If you're
looking into contributing contents, this is likely the place to look at.

Building and testing the site is easy:

----
git clone https://github.com/groovy/groovy-website.git          <1>
cd groovy-website
./gradlew generate                                              <2>
----
<1> clones the repository
<2> generates the website from templates

The output will be visible in `<project directory>/site/build/site`. There's also a `checkDeadlinks` tasks that we will
use once we get out of the beta phase to ensure that the generated pages do not contain any dead link.

Internally, we use our https://ci.groovy-lang.org/viewType.html?buildTypeId=Groovy_Website&guest=1[CI server] to deploy
changes to the `master` branch live. So any commit which is pushed onto the master branch is automatically published
(in general, takes less than 2 minutes).

=== Adding contents

Even if the site is statically generated, we still have data. In this project, there's an important file, named
https://github.com/groovy/groovy-website/blob/master/site/src/site/sitemap.groovy[sitemap.groovy] which handles a lot
of the contents of the website. It is our "low cost" database and as you can see, it's a DSL describing the contents
of the website.

For example, you can see the `menu` section which looks like this:

[source,groovy]
----
menu {
    group('Groovy') {
        item 'Learn',                       'learn.html'
        item 'Documentation',               'documentation.html'
        item 'Download',                    'download.html'
        item 'Community',                   'community.html'
        item 'Ecosystem',                   'ecosystem.html'
    }

    group('About') {
        item 'Contributing',                'contribute.html'
        item 'Source code',                 'https://github.com/groovy/groovy-core'
        item 'Books',                       'learn.html#books'
        item 'Sponsors',                    'sponsors.html'
        item 'FAQ',                         'faq.html'
        item 'Search',                      'search.html'
    }

    // ...
}
----

It is a purely declarative description of the site menus. Actually, the "Groups" are used in the footer of the page,
while the main `Groovy` group is used to generate the top navigation bar. Using a simple descriptive DSL is very interesting,
because it decouples templates from the contents of the menu. We make sure that those templates do not contain any element
which is hardcoded and reduce the risks of forgetting to update the footer, for example, if a section is added.

The same file is used to describe the list of downloads:

[source,groovy]
----
downloads {
    // ...
    distribution('Groovy 2.3') {
        description {
            yield 'Groovy 2.3 is our latest official '
            a(href: 'versioning.html', 'version')
            yield ' of Groovy.'
        }

        version('2.3.4') {
            stable true
            releaseNotes 'https://jira.codehaus.org/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?projectId=10242&version=20432'
            windowsInstaller 'https://dist.codehaus.org/groovy/distributions/installers/windows/nsis/groovy-2.3.4-installer.exe'
        }
    }
    // ...
}
----

or the books which are listed on the https://beta.groovy-lang.org/learn.html[learn page]:

[source,groovy]
----
books {
    book('Groovy in Action, 2nd edition') {
        authors "Dierk König, Guillaume Laforge, Paul King, Cédric Champeau, Hamlet D'Arcy, Erik Pragt, and Jon Skeet"
        cover 'img/books/regina.png'
        url 'https://www.manning.com/koenig2/'
        description 'The undisputed definitive reference on the Groovy programming language, authored by core members of the development team.'
    }
    // ...
}
----

The same is done for all contents that need regular updates: user groups, events, projects of the ecosystem, ... I think
this DSL provides a very nice way to add contents to the website without caring about where it has to be done. You can
really think of it as a small database, but making use of a Groovy DSL.

In addition, this file also declares the https://github.com/groovy/groovy-website/blob/03e3806cf26af6b13d99e6ee7473687e3f36fedd/site/src/site/sitemap.groovy#L62-L74[mapping between pages in the documentation section]
and https://beta.groovy-lang.org/documentation.html[the documentation page]. Last but not least, it lists the individual
pages that the website contain. Those pages make use of the {markuptemplateengine}.

=== Eat your own dog food

In Groovy 2.3, we introduced a new {markuptemplateengine}. We decided that the new web site was an excellent showcase of
this template engine, and a real life use case. This template engine has several remarkable features, like static compilation
of templates (even if the model is dynamic), layouts and of course a human readable builder like syntax:

[source,groovy]
----
html {
   head {
    title 'Groovy markup template engine in action!'
   }
   body {
    ul {
        features.each { f-> li(f.name) }
    }
   }
}
----

It has already been integrated into https://spring.io/blog/2014/05/28/using-the-innovative-groovy-template-engine-in-spring-boot[Spring Boot]
and {ratpack} will use it in the next version (to be released on August 1st). A hint about its performance can be found https://github.com/ratpack/ratpack/pull/370[here].
If you are interested in details about how it works, you can find the documentation https://beta.groovy-lang.org/docs/latest/html/documentation/markup-template-engine.html[here]
and you can read my https://melix.github.io/blog/2014/02/markuptemplateengine.html[blog posts] about it.

The website subproject is therefore organized accordingly. Inside the https://github.com/groovy/groovy-website/tree/master/site/src/site[main source tree], you'll find the following directories:

* assets: contains static assets, like Javascript, CSS, images, ...
* html: contains pure HTML files which are easier to embed as is than using a markup syntax
* includes: contains elements of code which are shared among multiple templates
* layouts: contains template layouts, as defined in the https://beta.groovy-lang.org/docs/latest/html/documentation/markup-template-engine.html#_layouts[documentation]
* pages: contains the main pages of the website

In general, consider `pages` as the entry point. A page generally makes use of one layout. As an example, let's see how
the https://beta.groovy-lang.org/ecosystem.html[Ecosystem] page is generated. The source file consists of this:

[source,groovy]
.ecosystem.groovy
----
layout 'layouts/main.groovy', true,                                             <1>
    pageTitle: 'The Groovy programming language - Ecosystem',                   <2>
    mainContent: contents {                                                     <3>
      div(id: 'content', class: 'page-1') {
        section(class: 'row') {
          div(class: 'row-fluid') {
            // ... snip side menu ...
            div(class: 'col-lg-8 col-lg-pull-0') {
              include template: 'includes/contribute-button.groovy'             <4>
              h1 {
                i(class: 'fa fa-leaf') {}
                yield ' Ecosystem'
              }
              p {
                yield '''
                    Beside the language and its API, Groovy gave birth   ...
                    on various themes such as web frameworks, desktop    ...

              '''
              }
              hr(class: 'divider')

              ecosys.eachWithIndex { e, index ->                                <5>
                def (name, item) = [e.key, e.value]
                article {
                  a(name: "${name}") {}
                  div(class:"content-heading clearfix media") {
                    div {
                      if (item.logo) {
                        img class: "pull-${(index % 2 == 0) ? 'left' : 'right'}",
                          src: item.logo, alt: name, hspace: '20px'
                      } else {
                        h2(name)
                      }
                      p(item.description)
                    }
                    a(href: item.url, target:'_blank', "Learn more...")
                  }
                }
                hr(class: 'divider')
              }
              // ...
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
----
<1> make use of the `main` layout
<2> the layout requires a `pageTitle` variable
<3> as well as a `mainContent` section corresponding to the main page contents
<4> example of use of an `include`
<5> iterates over the `ecosys` variable which contains the list of ecosystem projects as found in the sitemap

As you can see, this template format has the advantage of taking care of generating markup for you. You won't hit your
head again on the wall to find an unclosed tag. Everything is embedded, readable and concise.

=== Lessons learnt

Using the {markuptemplateengine} for this project was interesting, because it was probably the first "real life" project
to use it intensively. And as such, we discovered usability issues, but also bugs. Hopefully, none of those bugs or
usability features were critical, and everything could be worked around, but expect some fixes in Groovy 2.3.5. It is
also the reason why the project initially used {gradle}: it comes with Groovy 2.3.2 which embeds the {markuptemplateengine},
so it was possible to use it *without* organizing the project into separate modules like we have. In fact, the early
versions of the site didn't use subprojects. It's only when we wanted to leverage improvements from Groovy 2.3.4 that
we had to https://github.com/groovy/groovy-website/commit/e922701f747dbb78a7e695796c60d2b783f7e7ee[switch to that architecture].

== A team work

In the end, I can't finish this blog post without mentionning the team work it implied. In particular:

* https://twitter.com/oodamien[Damien Vitrac] designed the website and produced HTML sketches. If you think the new site
looks good, thank this guy!
* https://twitter.com/glaforge[Guillaume Laforge] designed the site architecture, wrote contents, tweaked the CSS, that is to
 say produced almost all contents. He spent countless hours fixing responsiveness issues and digging into front-end dev.
* https://twitter.com/CedricChampeau[I streamlined] the process by setting up the Gradle project, designing the sitemap DSL,
the integration of the {markuptemplateengine}, CI integration, ... that is to say pretty much all the "backend" stuff.
* *You*, as a community, provided awesome https://github.com/groovy/groovy-website/pulls?direction=desc&page=1&sort=created&state=closed[pull requests] within hours. Keep them coming, we love it!

Each of us have different skills. Guillaume is far better than I am in any kind of web design, styling issues, etc for example, so in the
end, I think the combination works quite good and that the site as it is now is already pretty usable.

Let us know what you think, and don't forget that you can contribute, it's easy!
