== Are you working in a multi-repository setup? 

In general, things start getting messy as soon as you have a feature which requires changes to more than one repository.
For example, you may have a `core` repository, and a `module` repository, and the feature that you're working on for `module` requires API changes in `module`.

If so, it's likely that you've been annoyed by the fact that to be able to test the changes to `module`, you minimally had to publish a local snapshot to your local Maven repository.
While this can kind of work locally, it's easy to miss publishing from time to time, and therefore thinking that a change works when it actually relies on an outdated dependency.

Things get more complicated as soon as CI is involved, or that you want to share the results of work in progress, for example for review, with your colleagues:

- did you ever had to explain that they had to checkout `core/some-branch`, publish to Maven local, then checkout `module/some-feature-branch` and test it?
- did you ever realize late that you forgot to push changes to `master` so that they could try?
- did you ever complain that to make this happen on CI, you actually had to _eagerly merge_ your feature branch to `core`, just so that the other repository, on a _feature branch_, could see it?
- did you ever want to see if your modules simply do not break with latest _master_, without having to change anything to your build scripts?

If you answered yes to any of those questions, then I'm glad to say **there's a solution!**

The underlying problem is that using Maven SNAPSHOTs to deal with multi-repository development is not a good enough.
It cannot model the complexity of multi-repository development, with features being developed concurrently on different branches.
Using SNAPSHOTs (binary dependencies) to coordinate projects leads to hard to diagnose bugs, broken integration processes. 
You typically have to eagerly push changes, or wait for snapshots to be published on a shared repository, just so that you can actually verify that integration with other modules work.
Those problems do not happen in a a _single repository_ world, because all changes are integrated at once.


I faced this very same problem with Micronaut:I'm currently working on a feature which involves changes to multiple repositories at once:

- https://github.com/micronaut-projects/micronaut-core/[Micronaut Core], with additional public APIs
- https://github.com/micronaut-projects/micronaut-aot/[Micronaut AOT], the new module I'm actively working on
- https://github.com/micronaut-projects/micronaut-gradle-plugin/[the Micronaut Gradle Plugin], which integrates the AOT module
- and a local test project which uses the modified Gradle plugin

That's, minimally 4 different projects, and a change to any of them is a pain to deal with.
With my experience with Gradle, I _knew_ there was a better way.

== A plugin to make it easier!

Today, I'm happy to announce a new Gradle plugin which aims at making multi-repository development a breeze: https://melix.github.io/includegit-gradle-plugin[Included Git repositories plugin].

This plugin lets you _import Git repositories_ as source dependencies, without having to change your dependency declarations.
What does that mean?
In the example above, it means that I can explain, when I'm working on `module`, that it needs to build against `core/some-branch`: Gradle will then automatically checkout the project, build the branch and _substitute_ any binary dependency corresponding to `core` with the source dependency.

In a nutshell, the configuration would look like this:

```groovy
gitRepositories {
	include('core') {
		uri = 'git@github.com:mycompany/core.git'
		branch = 'some-branch'
	}
}
```

That's it! No need to change your build scripts to update dependency coordinates, Gradle will do the magic!

It completely changes the way of thinking about multi-repository development, because CI, or colleagues, would not have to care about instructions about how to build your particular branch: everything is known upfront.

Of course, you're going to tell that well, that's cool but it still requires you to push your changes to the remote repository so that you can test things _locally_.
Well, a good multi-repository development story must integrate both the _local_ and _remote_ experience.
This is why this plugin actually makes it a breeze to support this pattern.

There are actually 2 ways you can handle this.
The first one is to explain to Gradle that instead of checking out the sources, it can simply use a local copy instead.
In this case, the plugin will simply _ignore_ whatever you declared in the `gitRepositories` block for the repository, and use whatever is available locally.
For this you'd set a `local.git.<repoName>` Gradle property (in your `gradle.properties` file) pointing to your local copy.
In the example above, I would for example add a `local.git.core` property pointing to my local copy of `core`.

Alternatively, if you keep things organized into checkout directories like I do, it's likely that you have all your `micronaut` related projects in a single `micronaut-projects` directory.
In this case, by setting the `auto.include.git.dirs` Gradle property to the `micronaut-projects` directory, the plugin will automatically map directory names in that `micronaut-projects` directory to included Git repository names.
So if I have:

```groovy
gitRepositories {
	include('micronaut-core') {
		uri = 'git@github.com:mycompany/core.git'
		branch = 'some-branch'
	}
}
```

and a `micronaut-core` directory under `micronaut-projects`, then it will automatically be used instead of cloned from remote.

Those options make it extremely convenient to develop locally, and only push changes when ready.
On CI, builds would checkout the dependents automatically, and you'd have nothing to configure.

== More complex use cases

The very same mechanism can be used to create "integration" builds on CI.
For example, it makes it very simple to have builds which would automatically build against the latest state of `master`, instead of having to wait for `SNAPSHOT` to be published, and more importantly, without having to change any build file.
As a bonus, it also works for _transitive dependencies_: for example if you have A --depends on--> B --depends on--> C, then you may want to make sure that if `C` is changed, `A` still works. How do you do this with snapshots, if there's no direct dependency between `A` and `C`? This plugin makes it very simple to test: just declare a Git repository for C and you're done!

== Need your help!

I think this plugin has potential to dramatically change how we develop in the multi-repository world.
The plugin is in very early stages, and I will need your help: report bugs, improve the documentation, improve testing, etc.
It will also be interesting to get your user stories so that we, collectively, can improve it to support more scenarios.
