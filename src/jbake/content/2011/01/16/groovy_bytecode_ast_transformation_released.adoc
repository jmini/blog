Following https://www.jroller.com/melix/entry/yes_fibonacci_in_groovy_can[my post about Fibonacci performance in Groovy], Guillaume Laforge gently asked me to continue my work, so I’m releasing the first version of a Groovy AST transformation which allows you to write a method body directly as bytecode. There are several usages for this, but I think the most important is educational : it’s one of the simplest (if not the simplest) way of testing JVM bytecode.

Here’s an example of what you may write :

[source]
----
@groovyx.ast.bytecode.Bytecode
int fib(int i) {
    iload 1
    iconst_2
    if_icmpge l1
    iload 1
    _goto l2
   l1
    aload 0
    iload 1
    iconst_2
    isub
    invokevirtual '.fib', '(I)I'
    aload 0
    iload 1
    iconst_1
    isub
    invokevirtual '.fib' ,'(I)I'
    iadd
   l2
    ireturn
}
println fib(40)

Downloads and sources
---------------------

You must use the groovy-all version of Groovy for this AST transform to work. Then, download the following jar :

* https://github.com/downloads/melix/groovy-bytecode-ast/groovy-bytecode-ast-0.1.0.jar[groovy-bytecode-ast-0.1.0.jar]

Sources are built with https://gradle.org/[Gradle] and tests made with https://code.google.com/p/spock/[the Spock framework]. Unit tests are also a great source of documentation, do hot hesitate to check them out.
