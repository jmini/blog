An ASM bytecode outline plugin for IntelliJ IDEA
------------------------------------------------

Today, I’ve just submitted a new plugin which integrates https://asm.ow2.org/index.html[ASM] bytecode views into IntelliJ IDEA : it’s a bytecode outline plugin similar to https://asm.ow2.org/eclipse/index.html[the one provided for Eclipse]. It was really a pain for me to work with Eclipse, so I eventually decided to write my own plugin for my favorite IDE. It’s in early stages, but it just suits my needs right now.

I have released it under an Apache 2 license, so there’s no problem for you to contribute if you want to improve it. By the way, this is also a test for me, since source code is available at https://github.com/melix/asm-bytecode-intellij[GitHut] and that I’m not really familiar with Git concepts.

Until the release is available from Jetbrain’s plugin manager, you may download the first release https://github.com/downloads/melix/asm-bytecode-intellij/asm-bo-0.2.zip[here].

Update
~~~~~~

I’ve uploaded a new version (0.2) which solves a problem under Windows, and doesn’t force compile when not necessary.

Here are a couple of screenshots :

Usage
~~~~~

It’s fairly easy : just right click on the editor, and choose ``Bytecode Outline''. Your class will be compiled, and the bytecode will be shown in the tool window on the right. Note that I plan not to compile the class if the binary is up to date, but I’m facing a strange bug in IntelliJ right now when I do so.
