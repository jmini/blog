While there’s still no decision made on the integration of closure to the Java language (AFAIK), I think the https://www.javac.info/[BGGA proposal] is the most promising candidate. I’m quite confident it will eventually be integrated to the language.

However, I was wondering about the syntax of the proposal, mainly because more and more programmers are using closures in Groovy. Basically, you’ll write a closure in Groovy like this :

[source]
----
{ x,y -> x+y }

----


In the BGGA proposal, the syntax is more verbose because Java is strongly typed :

[source]
----
{int x, int y => x + y}

----


Everything would be fine, but I was wondering about the _=>_ separator, which _can_ be confusing :

[source]
----
{int x, int y => x >= y }

----


IMHO, it would be better if the proposal followed the syntax that’s getting known by more and more people, that is to say the Groovy one : replacing _=>_ with _->_

What do you think ?
