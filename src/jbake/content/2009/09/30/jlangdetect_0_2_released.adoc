JLangDetect 0.2 released !
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is a small update which includes the following features :

* Ability to detect the language of a document using a subset of the languages used for training
* Logs now managed by log4j

The ability to use a subset of the languages used for training is important if you know that a document must be written in french or english, for example, but the detector has been trained for more languages. Using a subset will ensure that the detector returns one of those languages.
